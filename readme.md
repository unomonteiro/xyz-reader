## Project Overview

In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## Why this Project?

This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you will:

-   Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
-   Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
-   Separate an interface into surfaces.
-   Effectively use transitions and motion.

## User Feedback for XYZ Reader:

### Lyla says:

“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

### Jay says:

“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

### Kagure says:

“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”

### Me
- Text
- colors
- speed
